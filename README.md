# Accident-Alert-System
The Accident Alert System uses an ADXL-335 accelerometer to detect crashes and sends an SMS alert via the SIM800L GSM module. The L89 GPS module provides the location of the incident. Built on Arduino Uno, it offers a low-cost, real-time solution to improve emergency response and road safety.
