The Accident Alert System is an embedded safety solution designed to detect vehicular accidents and immediately notify emergency contacts with critical information. Using the ADXL-335 accelerometer, the system senses sudden impacts or abnormal motion patterns. When an accident is detected, the SIM800L GSM module sends an SMS alert, and the L89 GPS module provides the real-time location of the incident. Built on the Arduino Uno platform, this system offers a low-cost, real-time solution to improve emergency response and potentially save lives in road accidents.
